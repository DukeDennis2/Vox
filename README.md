# Vox
Vox is a modern, minimalist web application built with TypeScript, React, and TSX, designed to help you project your words beautifully and boldly in real time.

Unlike other text preview tools or meme caption generators, Vox allows you to type text and instantly see it displayed in a bold, center-aligned style. You can easily adjust the viewing mode (light, dark, or green), making it perfect for creating aesthetic screenshots, live presentations, or even custom meme images.


💻 Built with:
    🟦 TypeScript — for type safety and cleaner code.

    ⚛️ React (TSX) — to build a smooth, interactive, and reactive UI.

    💅 CSS-in-JS (inline styles) — for flexible, dynamic styling.

🎨 Features
- Live text projection — Whatever you type is displayed instantly and dynamically.
- Adaptive font scaling — The text shrinks automatically to fit any screen size without cutting off.
- Color modes — Easily switch between:
- Default (white background, black text)
- Dark mode (black background, white text)
- Green mode (green background, black text)
- Beautiful, minimalist input box — Clean design to focus on your words.
- Footer branding — Includes an automatic copyright footer with your project name.

🖼️ Create memes & aesthetic text images

- 1️⃣ Type your text (a joke, phrase, quote, or lyric).
- 2️⃣ Choose a color mode to match your mood.

- 4️⃣ Share instantly on social media!
